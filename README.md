CS 2336 Project 1 on API. Bot name - scottbot, freenode channel - #scottbot

Download Pircbot 1.5.0 and store it in .\pircbot-1.5.0\pircbot-1.5.0\<pircbot>
(<pirbot> is the jar file itself)

Download additional jar files and store them in .\jar_files :
  1. json-simple-1.1 -> don't download any other version
  2. twitter4j-4.0.7 -> the jar file that we include should be in .\jar_files\twitter4j-4.0.7\lib\<twitter4j-core-4.0.7> 
  (twitter4j-core-4.0.7) is the jar file we use
  
You need to create accounts and get API keys of Twitter, Open Weather Map, Youtube, Amdoren Time API
This can be easily googled to know how.

Enter those keys in MyBot.java at the places defined after the imports

After running the bot, it can be found in channel #scottbot at https://webchat.freenode.net/
